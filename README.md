PocketChem is a periodic table and chemistry reference app designed for iOS devices, written purely with Swift and SwiftUI.

I first developed PocketChem in high school over four years ago to help high school students in their chemistry classes. PocketChem 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the original PocketChem, including a brand-new design, full landscape orientation support for iPad, and fixes many bugs that existed on the previous version.

PocketChem was first released while I was in my first ever programming class in high school. Now that I am in my final semester of undergrad studies, it has been super fun to revisit this older project and update it using all of the techniques I have learned over the last four years!

For instructional and portfolio value, PocketChem's source code is available for viewing here on this GitHub page. This README file also includes some notes on PocketChem's architecture and design.
