It is also used in large quantities in methanol production, in hydrodealkylation, hydrocracking, and hydrodesulfurization. Other uses include rocket fuel, welding, producing hydrochloric acid, reducing metallic ores, and filling balloons.  The lifting power of 1 cubic foot of hydrogen gas is about 0.07 lb at °C, 760 mm pressure.  The hydrogen fuel cell is a developing technology that will allow great amounts of electrical power to be obtained using a source of hydrogen gas. Consideration is being given to an entire economy based on solar- and nuclear-generated hydrogen. Public acceptance, high capital investment, and the high cost of hydrogen with respect to today's fuels are but a few of the problems facing such an economy.  Located in remote regions, power plants would electrolyze seawater; the hydrogen produced would travel to distant cities by pipelines. Pollution-free hydrogen could replace natural gas, gasoline, etc., and could serve as a reducing agent in metallurgy, chemical processing, refining, etc. It could also be used to convert trash into methane and ethylene.

    "uses": " as an inert gas shield for arc welding; a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals and producing titanium and zirconium; as a cooling medium for nuclear reactors, and as a gas for supersonic wind tunnels.  A mixture of helium and oxygen is used as an artificial atmosphere for divers and others working under pressure. Different ratios of He and O2 are used for different diver operation depths. Helium is extensively used for filling balloons as it is a much safer gas than hydrogen. One of the recent largest uses for helium has been for pressuring liquid fuel rockets. A Saturn booster, like the type used on the Apollo lunar missions, required about 13 million ft3 of helium for a firing, plus more for checkouts. Liquid helium's use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to increase as the medical profession accepts and develops new uses for the equipment. This equipment has eliminated some need for exploratory surgery by accurately diagnosing patients. Another medical application uses MRE to determine (by blood analysis) whether a patient has any form of cancer. Helium is also being used to advertise on blimps for various companies, including Goodyear. Other lifting gas applications are being developed by the Navy and Air Force to detect low-flying cruise missiles. Additionally, the Drug Enforcement Agency is using radar-equipped blimps to detect drug smugglers along the United States boarders. In addition, NASA is currently using helium-filled balloons to sample the atmosphere in Antarctica to determine what is depleting the ozone layer. ",

Forms Carbon is found free in nature in three allotropic forms: graphite, diamond, and fullerines. A fourth form, known as \"white\" carbon, is now thought to exist. Ceraphite is one of the softest known materials while diamond is one of the hardest. Graphite exists in two forms: alpha and beta. These have identical physical properties, except for their crystal structure. Naturally occurring graphites are reported to contain as much as 30% of the rhombohedral (beta) form, whereas synthetic materials contain only the alpha form. The hexagonal alpha type can be converted to the beta by mechanical treatment, and the beta form reverts to the alpha on heating it above 1000'b0C. In 1969 a new allotropic form of carbon was produced during the sublimation of pyrolytic graphite at low pressures. Under free-vaporization conditions above ~2550'b0K, \"white\" carbon forms as small transparent crystals on the edges of the planes of graphite. The interplanar spacings of \"white\" carbon are identical to those of carbon form noted in the graphite gneiss from the Ries (meteroritic) Crater of Germany. \"White\" carbon is a transparent birefringent material. Little information is presently available about this allotrope. \n\nCompounds\n In combination, carbon is found as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the earth and dissolved in all natural waters. It is a component of great rock masses in the form of carbonates of calcium (limestone), magnesium, and iron. Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are chiefly hydrocarbons. Carbon is unique among the elements in the vast number and variety of compounds it can form. With hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements, it forms a very large number of compounds, carbon atom often being linked to another carbon atom. There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes. Without carbon, the basis for life would be impossible. While it has been thought that silicon might take the place of carbon in forming a host of similar compounds, it is now not possible to form stable compounds with very long chains of silicon atoms. The atmosphere of Mars contains 96.2% CO2. Some of the most important compounds of carbon are carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon disulfide (CS2), chloroform (CHCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2), benzene (C6H6), acetic acid (CH3COOH), and their derivatives. \n\nIsotopes\n Carbon has seven isotopes. In 1961 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry adopted the isotope carbon-12 as the basis for atomic weights. Carbon-14, an isotope with a half-life of 5715 years, has been widely used to date such materials as wood, archaeological specimens, etc.",

It is obtained by liquefaction of air and separated from the other gases by fractional distillation. \n\nIsotopes\n Natural neon is a mixture of three isotopes. Six other unstable isotopes are known. \n\nCompounds\n Neon is a very inert element,  however, it has been reported to form a compound with fluorine. It is still questionable if true compounds of neon exist, but evidence is mounting in favor of their existence. The ions, Ne+, (NeAr)+, (NeH)+, and (HeNe+) are known from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Neon also forms an unstable hydrate. Properties In a vacuum discharge tube, neon glows reddish orange. It has over 40 times more refrigerating capacity per unit volume than liquid helium and more than three times that of liquid hydrogen. It is compact, inert, and is less expensive than helium when it meets refrigeration requirements. Of all the rare gases, the discharge of neon is the most intense at ordinary voltages and currents. Uses Although neon advertising signs account for the bulk of its use, neon also functions in high-voltage indicators, lightning arrestors, wave meter tubes, and TV tubes.

In 1761 de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the base in alum, and Lavoisier, in 1787, thought this to be the oxide of a still undiscovered metal. Friedrich Wohler is generally credited with having isolated the metal in 1827, although an impure form was prepared by Oersted two years earlier. In 1807, Davy proposed the name aluminium for the metal, undiscovered at that time, and later agreed to change it to aluminum. Shortly thereafter, the name aluminum was adopted to conform with the \"ium\" ending of most elements. Aluminium was also the accepted spelling in the U.S. until 1925, at which time the American Chemical Society decided to use the name aluminum thereafter in their publications. See the Wikipedia entry on Aluminium for additional discussion on the spelling of this element.",

In the form of sand and clay it is used to make concrete and brick; it is a useful refractory material for high-temperature work, and in the form of silicates it is used in making enamels, pottery, etc. Silica, as sand, is a principal ingredient of glass, one of the most inexpensive of materials with excellent mechanical, optical, thermal, and electrical properties. Glass can be made in a very great variety of shapes, and is used as containers, window glass, insulators, and thousands of other uses. Silicon tetrachloride can be used as iridize glass.  Hyperpure silicon can be doped with boron, gallium, phosphorus, or arsenic to produce silicon for use in transistors, solar cells, rectifiers, and other solid-state devices which are used extensively in the electronics and space-age industries. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon has shown promise in producing economical cells for converting solar energy into electricity. Silicon is important to plant and animal life. Diatoms in both fresh and salt water extract Silica from the water to build their cell walls. Silica is present in the ashes of plants and in the human skeleton. Silicon is an important ingredient in steel; silicon carbide is one of the most important abrasives and has been used in lasers to produce coherent light of 4560 A. Silcones are important products of silicon. They may be prepared by hydrolyzing a silicon organic chloride, such as dimethyl silicon chloride. Hydrolysis and condensation of various substituted chlorosilanes can be used to produce a very great number of polymeric products, or silicones, ranging from liquids to hard, glasslike solids with many useful properties. Properties Crystalline silicon has a metallic luster and grayish color. Silicon is a relatively inert element, but it is attacked by halogens and dilute alkali. Most acids, except hydrofluoric, do not affect it. Elemental silicon transmits more than 95% of all wavelengths of infrared, from 1.3 to 6.y micro-m. \n\nHandling\nMiners, stonecutters, and others engaged in work where siliceous dust is breathed into large quantities often develop a serious lung disease known as silicosis.

It is also extensively used in the production of paper products, dyestuffs, textiles, petroleum products, medicines, antiseptics, insecticides, food, solvents, paints, plastics, and many other consumer products. Most of the chlorine produced is used in the manufacture of chlorinated compounds for sanitation, pulp bleaching, disinfectants, and textile processing. Further use is in the manufacture of chlorates, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and in the extraction of bromine. Organic chemistry demands much from chlorine, both as an oxidizing agent and in substitution, since it often brings many desired properties in an organic compound when substituted for hydrogen, as in one form of synthetic rubber. \n\nHandling\nChlorine is a respiratory irritant. The gas irritates the mucus membranes and the liquid burns the skin. As little as 3.5 ppm can be detected as an odor, and 1000 ppm is likely to be fatal after a few deep breaths.

The pure metal is not often encountered in commerce, but is usually alloyed with carbon or other metals. Properties The pure metal is very reactive chemically and rapidly corrodes, especially in moist air or at elevated temperatures. It has four allotropic forms or ferrites, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and omega, with transition points at 700, 928, and 1530C. The alpha form is magnetic, but when transformed into the beta form, the magnetism disappears although the lattice remains unchanged. The relations of these forms are peculiar. Pig iron is an alloy containing about 3 percent carbon with varying amounts of sulfur, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus. Iron is hard, brittle, fairly fusible, and is used to produce other alloys, including steel. Wrought iron contains only a few tenths of a percent of carbon, is tough, malleable, less fusible, and usually has a \"fibrous\" structure. Carbon steel is an alloy of iron with small amounts of Mn, S, P, and Si. Alloy steels are carbon steels with other additives such as nickel, chromium, vanadium, etc. Iron is a cheap, abundant, useful, and important metal.  ",

An alloy containing 87 percent zinc has been found in prehistoric ruins in Transylvania. Metallic zinc was produced in the 13th century A.D. India by reducing calamine with organic substances such as wool. The metal was rediscovered in Europe by Marggraf in 1746. He demonstrated that zinc could be obtained by reducing calamine with charcoal.",

    "uses": "The metal is employed to form numerous alloys with other metals. Brass, nickel silver, typewriter metal, commercial bronze, spring bronze, German silver, soft solder, and aluminum solder are some of the more important alloys. Large quantities of zinc are used to produce die castings, which are used extensively by the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. An alloy called Prestal(R), consisting of 78 percent zinc and 22 percent aluminum, is reported to be almost as strong as steel and as easy to mold as plastic. The alloy said to be so moldable that it can be molded into form using inexpensive ceramics or cement die casts. Zinc is also used extensively to galvanize other metals such as iron to prevent corrosion. Zinc oxide is a unique and very useful material for modern civilization. It is widely used in the manufacture of paints, rubber products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, floor coverings, plastics, printing inks, soap, storage batteries, textiles, electrical equipment, and other products. Lithopone, a mixture of zinc sulfide and barium sulfate, is an important pigment. Zinc sulfide is used in making luminous dials, X-ray and TV screens, and fluorescent lights. The chloride and chromate are also important compounds. Zinc is an essential element in the growth of human beings and animals. Tests show that zinc-deficient animals require 50 percent more food to gain the same weight as an animal supplied with sufficient zinc. \n\nHandling\nZinc is not considered to be toxic, but when freshly formed ZnO is inhaled a disorder known as oxide shakes or zinc chills sometimes occurs. Where zinc oxide is encountered, recommendations include providing good ventilation to avoid concentration exceeding 5 mg/m3, (time-weighted over an 8-hour exposure, 40-hour work week).  ",

Germanium and germanium oxide are transparent to the infrared and are used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment, including extremely sensitive infrared detectors. The high index of refraction and dispersion properties of its oxide's have made germanium useful as a component of wide-angle camera lenses and microscope objectives.

Elemental arsenic occurs in two solid modifications: yellow, and gray or metallic, with specific gravities of 1.97, and 5.73, respectively. It is believed that Albertus Magnus obtained the element in 1250 A.D. In 1649 Schroeder published two methods of preparing the element. Mispickel arsenopyrite, (FeSAs), is the most common mineral from which, on heating, the arsenic sublimes leaving ferrous sulfide. Properties The element is a steel gray, very brittle, crystalline, semimetallic solid; it tarnishes in air, and when  it is heated it rapidly oxidizes to arsenous oxide, which smells of garlic.

    "history": "From the Greek word Selene, moon. Discovered by Berzelius in 1817, who found it associated with tellurium (named for the earth). Production Selenium is found in a few rare minerals such as crooksite and clausthalite. In years past it has been obtained from flue dusts remaining from processing copper sulfide ores, but the anode metal from electrolytic copper refineries now provide the source of most of the world's selenium. Selenium is recovered by roasting the mud with soda or sulfuric acid, or by smelting them with soda and niter. Properties Selenium exists in several allotropic forms, although three are generally recognized. Selenium can be prepared with either an amorphous or a crystalline structure. The color of amorphous selenium is either red (in powder form) or black (in vitreous form). Crystalline monoclinic selenium is a deep red; crystalline hexagonal selenium, the most stable variety, is a metallic gray. Selenium exhibits both photovoltaic action, where light is converted directly into electricity, and photoconductive action, where the electrical resistance decreases with increased illumination. These properties make selenium useful in the production of photocells and exposure meters for photographic use, as well as solar cells. Selenium is also able to convert a.c. electricity to d.c., and is extensively used in rectifiers. Below its melting point, selenium is a p-type semiconductor and has many uses in electronic and solid-state applications. Elemental selenium has been said to be practically nontoxic and is considered to be an essential trace element; however, hydrogen selenide and other selenium compounds are extremely toxic, and resemble arsenic in their physiological reactions. \n\nIsotopes\n Naturally selenium contains six stable isotopes. Fifteen other isotopes have been characterized. The element is a member of the sulfur family and resembles sulfur both in its various forms and in its compounds. Uses Selenium is used in Xerography for reproducing and copying documents, letters, etc. It is used by the glass industry to decolorize glass and to make ruby-colored glasses and enamels.

It is also proposed for use as a working fluid for vapor turbines and for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an amature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium is used as a getter in vacuum tubes and as a photocell component. It has been used in making special glasses. RbAg4I5 is important, as it has the highest room conductivity of any known ionic crystal. At 20'b0C its conductivity is about the same as dilute sulfuric acid. This suggests use in thin film batteries and other applications.  ",

    "history": "Named after Strontian, a town in Scotland. Isolated by Davey by electrolysis in 1808, however, Adair Crawford  recognized a new mineral (strontianite) as differing from other barium minerals in 1790. Forms Strontium is found chiefly as celestite and strontianite. The metal can be prepared by electrolysis of the fused chloride mixed with potassium chloride, or is made by reducing strontium oxide with aluminum in a vacuum at a temperature at which strontium distills off. Three allotropic forms of the metal exist, with transition points at 235 and 540'b0C. Properties Strontium is softer than calcium and decomposes in water more vigorously. It does not absorb nitrogen below 380'b0C. It should be kept under kerosene to prevent oxidation. Freshly cut strontium has a silvery appearance, but rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. The finely divided metal ignites spontaneously in air. Volatile strontium salts impart a beautiful crimson color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes. \n\nIsotopes\n Sixteen other unstable isotopes are known to exist. Of greatest importance is 90Sr with a half-life of 29 years. It is a product of nuclear fallout and presents a health problem. This isotope is one of the best long-lived high-energy beta emitters known, and is used in SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxilliary Power) devices. These devices hold promise for use in space vehicles, remote weather stations, navigational buoys, etc., and where a lightweight, long-lived, nuclear-electric power source is needed. Uses In addition to the medical imaging application described in the image caption above, strontium has found use in producing ferrite magnets and in refining zinc. Strontium titanate is an interesting optical material as it has an extremely high refractive index and an optical dispersion greater than that of diamond. It has been used as a gemstone, but is very soft. It does not occur naturally.",

It is widely used in making YVO4 europium, and Y2O3 europium phosphors to give the red color in color television tubes. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are now used in this application. Yttrium oxide also is used to produce yttrium-iron-garnets, which are very effective microwave filters. Yttrium iron, aluminum, and gadolinium garnets, with formulas such as Y3Fe5O12 and Y3Al5O12, have interesting magnetic properties. Yttrium iron garnet is also exceptionally efficient as both a transmitter and transducer of acoustic energy. Yttrium aluminum garnet, with a hardness of 8.5, is also finding use as a gemstone (simulated diamond). Small amounts of yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) can be used to reduce the grain size in chromium, molybdenum, zirconium, and titanium, and to increase strength of aluminum and magnesium alloys. Alloys with other useful properties can be obtained by using yttrium as an additive. The metal can be used as a deoxidizer for vanadium and other nonferrous metals. The metal has a low cross section for nuclear capture. 90Y, one of the isotopes of yttrium, exists in equilibrium with its parent 90Sr, a product of nuclear explosions. Yttrium has been considered for use as a nodulizer for producing nodular cast iron, in which the graphite forms compact nodules instead of the usual flakes. Such iron has increased ductility. Yttrium also can be used in laser systems and as a catalyst for ethylene polymerization reactions. It also has potential use in ceramic and glass formulas, as the oxide has a high melting point and imparts shock resistance and low expansion characteristics to glass. \n\nIsotopes\n Natural yttrium contains one isotope, 89Y. Nineteen other unstable isotopes have been characterized.  ",

    "history": "From the Greek word technetos, artificial. Element 43 was predicted on the basis of the periodic table, and was erroneously reported as having been discovered in 1925, at which time it was named masurium. The element was actually discovered by Perrier and Segre in Italy in 1937. It was also found in a sample of molybdenum sent by E. Lawrence that was bombarded by deuterons in the Berkeley cyclotron. Technetium was the first element to be produced artificially. Since its discovery, searches for the element in terrestrial material have been made.  Finally in 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in African pitchblende (a uranium rich ore) in extremely minute quantities as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238 by B.T. Kenna and P.K. Kuroda.  If it does exist, the concentration must be very small. Technetium has been found in the spectrum of S-, M-, and N-type stars, and its presence in stellar matter is leading to new theories of the production of heavy elements in the stars. \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty-two isotopes of technetium with masses ranging from 90 to 111 are reported. All the isotopes of technetium are radioactive. It is one of two elements with Z < 83 that have no stable isotopes; the other element is promethium (Z = 61). Technetium has three long lived radioactive isotopes: 97Tc (T1/2 = 2.6 x 106 years), 98Tc (T1/2 = 4.2 x 106 years) and 99Tc (T1/2 = 2.1 x 105 years). 95Tcm (\"m\" stands for meta state) (T1/2 = 61 days) is used in tracer work. However, the most useful isotope of technetium is 99Tcm (T1/2 = 6.01 hours) is used in many medical radioactive isotope tests because of its half-life being short, the energy of the gamma ray it emits, and the ability of technetium to be chemically bound to many biologically active molecules. Because 99Tc is produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium in nuclear reactors, large quantities have been produced over the years. There are kilogram quantities of technetium currently existing. Properties Technetium is a silvery-gray metal that tarnishes slowly in moist air.  The common oxidation states of technetium are +7, +5, and +4. Under oxidizing conditions technetium (VII) will exist as the pertechnetate ion, TcO4-.  The chemistry of technetium is said to be similar to that of rhenium. Technetium dissolves in nitric acid, aqua regia, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any strength. The element is a remarkable corrosion inhibitor for steel. The metal is an excellent superconductor at 11K and below. \n\nHandling\nIt is reported that mild carbon steels may be effectively protected by as little as 55 ppm of KTcO4 in aerated distilled water at temperatures up to 250'b0C. This corrosion protection is limited to closed systems, since technetium is radioative and must be confined. 98Tc has a specific activity of 6.2 x 108 Bq/g. Activity of this level must not be allowed to spread. 99Tc is a contamination hazard and should be handled in a glove box.",

Plated rhodium, produced by electroplating or evaporation, is exceptionally hard and is used for optical instruments. Rhodium is also used for jewelry, for decoration, and as a catalyst. \n\nHandling\nExposure to rhodium (metal fume and dust, as Rh) should not exceed 1 mg/m^3 (8-hour time-weighted average, 40-hour week).",

Silver is of the utmost importance in photography, about 30% of the U.S. industrial consumption going into this application. It is used for dental alloys. Silver is used in making solder and brazing alloys, electrical contacts, and high capacity silver-zinc and silver-cadmium batteries. Silver paints are used for making printed circuits. It is used in mirror production and may be deposited on glass or metals by chemical deposition, electrode position, or by evaporation. When freshly deposited, it is the best reflector of visible light known, but is rapidly tarnished and loses much of its reflectance. It is a poor reflector of ultraviolet. Silver fulminate, a powerful explosive, is sometimes formed during the silvering process. Silver iodide is used in seeding clouds to produce rain. Silver chloride has interesting optical properties as it can be made transparent; it also is a cement for glass. Silver nitrate, or lunar caustic, the most important silver compound, is used extensively in photography. Silver for centuries has been used traditionally for coinage by many countries of the world. In recent times, however, consumption of silver has greatly exceeded the output. \n\nHandling\nWhile silver itself is not considered to be toxic, most of its salts are poisonous. Exposure to silver (metal and soluble compounds, as Ag) in air should not exceed 0.01 mg/m3, (8-hour time-weighted average - 40 hour week). Silver compounds can be absorbed in the circulatory system and reduced silver deposited in the various tissues of the body.

    "history": "From the Latin word cadmia, Greek kadmeia - the ancient name for calamine, zinc carbonate. Discovered by Stromeyer in 1817 from an impurity in zinc carbonate. Cadmium most often occurs in small quantities associated with zinc ores, such as sphalerite (ZnS). Greenockite (CdS) is the only mineral of any consequence bearing cadmium. Almost all cadmium is obtained as a by-product in the treatment of zinc, copper, and lead ores. It is a soft, bluish-white metal which is easily cut with a knife. It is similar in many respects to zinc.  In 1927 the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of the wavelength of the red cadmium spectral line (i.e. 1m = 1.553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has been changed (see Krypton). Uses Cadmium is a component of some of the lowest melting alloys; it is used in bearing alloys with low coefficients of friction and great resistance to fatigue; it is used extensively in electroplating, which accounts for about 60% of its use.

Xenon is a member of the so-called noble or \"inert\" gases. It is present in the atmosphere to the extent of about one part in twenty million. Xenon is present in the Martian atmosphere to the extent of 0.08 ppm. the element is found in the gases evolved from certain mineral springs, and is commercially obtained by extraction from liquid air. \n\nIsotopes\n Natural xenon is composed of nine stable isotopes. In addition to these, 20 unstable isotopes have been characterized. Before 1962, it had generally been assumed that xenon and other noble gases were unable to form compounds. Evidence has been mounting in the past few years that xenon, as well as other members of zero valance elements, do form compounds. Among the \"compounds\" of xenon now reported are sodium perxenate, xenon deuterate, xenon hydrate, difluoride, tetrafluoride, and hexafluoride. Xenon trioxide, which is highly explosive, has been prepared. More than 80 xenon compounds have been made with xenon chemically bonded to fluorine and oxygen. Some xenon compounds are colored. Metallic xenon has been produced, using several hundred kilobars of pressure. Xenon in a vacuum tube produces a beautiful blue glow when excited by an electrical discharge. Uses The gas is used in making electron tubes, stoboscopic lamps, bactericidal lamps, and lamps used to excite ruby lasers that generate coherent light.

Other separation techniques are possible. Properties The metal has a bright silvery metallic luster, Neodymium is one of the more reactive rare-earth metals and quickly tarnishes in air, forming an oxide that spalls off and exposes metal to oxidation. The metal, therefore, should be kept under light mineral oil or sealed in a plastic material. Neodymium exists in two allotropic forms, with a transformation from a double hexagonal to a body-centered cubic structure taking place at 863'b0C. \n\nIsotopes\n Natural neodymium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes.

In 1902 Branner predicted the existence of an element between neodymium and samarium, and this was confirmed by Moseley in 1914. In 1941, workers at Ohio State University irradiated neodymium and praseodymium with neutrons, deuterons, and alpha particles, and produced several new radioactivities, which most likely were those of element 61. Wu and Segre, and Bethe, in 1942, confirmed the formation; however, chemical proof of the production of element 61 was lacking because of the difficulty in separating the rare earths from each other at that time. In 1945, Marinsky, Glendenin, and Coryell made the first chemical identification by use of ion-exchange chromatography. Their work was done by fission of uranium and by neutron bombardment of neodymium.",

These lines subsequently have been shown to belong to europium. The discovery of europium is generally credited to Demarcay, who separated the rare earth in reasonably pure form in 1901. The pure metal was not isolated until recent years. Production Europium is now prepared by mixing Eu2O3 with a 10%-excess of lanthanum metal and heating the mixture in a tantalum crucible under high vacuum. The element is collected as a silvery-white metallic deposit on the walls of the crucible. Properties As with other rare-earth metals, except for lanthanum, europium ignites in air at about 150 to 180'b0C. Europium is about as hard as lead and is quite ductile. It is the most reactive of the rare-earth metals, quickly oxidizing in air. It resembles calcium in its reaction with water. Bastnasite and monazite are the principal ores containing europium.",

Neither the oxide nor the metal was available in relatively pure form until 1950, when the development of ion-exchange separation and metallographic reduction techniques were created by Spedding and associates. Dysprosium occurs along with other so-called rare-earth or lanthanide elements in a variety of minerals such as xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, and blomstrandine. The most important sources, however, are from monaziate and bastnasite. Dysprosium can be prepared by reduction of the trifluoride with calcium. Properties The element has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is relatively stable in air at room temperature, and is readily attacked and dissolved by dilute and concentrated mineral acids, to evolve hydrogen. The metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Small amounts of impurities can greatly affect its physical properties. Uses While we have not found many applications for dysprosium, its thermal neutron absorption cross-section and high melting point suggest metallurgical uses in nuclear control applications and for alloying with special stainless steels. A dysprosium oxide-nickel cement has found use in cooling nuclear reactor rods. This cement absorbs neutrons readily without swelling or contracting under prolonged neutron bombardment.

    "history": "Erbium, one of the so-called rare-earth elements on the lanthanide series, is found in the minerals mentioned under dysprosium. In 1842 Mosander separated \"yttria\" found in the mineral gadolinite, into three fractions which he called yttria, erbia, and terbia. The names erbia and terbia became confused in this early period. After 1860, Mosander's terbia was known as erbia, and after 1877, the earlier known erbia became terbia. The erbia of this period was later shown to consist of five oxides, now known as erbia, scandia, holmia, thulia and ytterbia. By 1905 Urbain and James independently succeeded in isolating fairly pure Er2O3. Klemm and Bommer first produced reasonably pure erbium metal in 1934 by reducing the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor. Properties The pure metal is soft and malleable and has a bright, silvery, metallic luster. As with other rare-earth metals, its properties depend to a certain extent on the impurities present. The metal is fairly stable in air and does not oxidize as rapidly as some of the other rare-earth metals. Naturally occurring erbium is a mixture of six isotopes, all of which are stable. Nine radioactive isotopes of erbium are also recognized. Recent production techniques, using ion-exchange reactions, have resulted in much lower prices of the rare-earth metals and their compounds in recent years. Most of the rare-earth oxides have sharp absorption bands in the visible, ultraviolet, and near infrared. This property, associated with the electronic structure, gives beautiful pastel colors to many of the rare-earth salts. Uses Erbium is finding nuclear and metallurgical uses. Added to vanadium, for example, erbium lowers the hardness and improves workability.  Erbium oxide gives a pink color and has been used as a colorant in glasses and porcelain enamel glazes.",

It is obtained commercially from monazite, which contains about 0.007% of the element. Thulium is the least abundant of the rare earth elements, but with new sources recently discovered, it is now considered to be about as rare as silver, gold, or cadmium. Properties Thulium can be isolated by reduction of the oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction of a closed container. The element is silver-gray, soft, malleable, and ductile, and can be cut with a knife. Twenty five isotopes are known, with atomic masses ranging from 152 to 176. Natural thulium, which is 100% 169Tm, is stable. Uses Because of the relatively high price of the metal, thulium has not yet found many practical applications. 169Tm bombarded in a nuclear reactor can be used as a radiation source in portable X-ray equipment. 171Tm is potentially useful as an energy source. Natural thulium also has possible use in ferrites (ceramic magnetic materials) used in microwave equipment, and can be used for doping fiber lasers.

    "history": "From Hafinia, the Latin name for Copenhagen. Many years before its discovery in 1923 (credited to D. Coster and G. von Hevesey), Hafnium was thought to be present in various minerals and concentrations. On the basis of the Bohr theory, the new element was expected to be associated with zirconium. It was finally identified in zircon from Norway, by means of X-ray spectroscope analysis. It was named in honor of the city in which the discovery was made. Most zirconium minerals contain 1 to 5 percent hafnium. It was originally separated from zirconium by repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by von Hevesey and Jantzen. Metallic hafnium was first prepared by van Arkel and deBoer by passing the vapor of the tetraiodide over a heated tungsten filament. Almost all hafnium metal now produced is made by reducing the tetrachloride with magnesium or with sodium (Kroll Process). Properties Hafnium is a ductile metal with a brilliant silver luster. Its properties are considerably influenced by presence of zirconium impurities. Of all the elements, zirconium and hafnium are two of the most difficult to separate. Although their chemistry is almost identical, the density of zirconium is about half of hafnium. Very pure hafnium has been produced, with zirconium being the major impurity. Hafnium has been successfully alloyed with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and other metals. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary composition known, and the nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides (m.p. 3310C). At 700 degrees C hafnium rapidly absorbs hydrogen to form the composition HfH1.86. Hafnium is resistant to concentrated alkalis, but at elevated temperatures reacts with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Halogens react directly to form tetrahalides. Uses Because the element not only has a good absorption cross section for thermal neutrons (almost 600 times that of zirconium), but also excellent mechanical properties and is extremely corrosion-resistant, hafnium is used for reactor control rods. Such rods are used in nuclear submarines. Hafnium is used in gas-filled and incandescent lamps, and is an efficient getter for scavenging oxygen and nitrogen. \n\nHandling\nFinely divided hafnium is pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air.

    "history": "From Swedish, tung sten meanig heavy stone. In 1779 Peter Woulfe examined the mineral now known as wolframite and concluded it must contain a new substance. Scheele, in 1781, found that a new acid could be made from tungsten (a name first applied about 1758 to a mineral now known as scheelite). Scheele and Berman suggested the possibility of obtaining a new metal by reducing this acid. The de Elhuyar brothers found acid in wolframite in 1783 that was identical to the acid of tungsten (tungstic acid) of Scheele, and in that year they succeeded in obtaining the element by reduction of this acid with charcoal. Tungsten occurs in wolframite, scheelite, huebnertie, and ferberite. Important deposits of tungsten occur in California, Colorado, South Korea, Bolivia, Russia, and Portugal. China is reported to have about 75% of the world's tungsten resources. Natural tungsten contains five stable isotopes. Twenty one other unstable isotopes are recognized. The metal is obtained commercially be reducing tungsten oxide with hydrogen or carbon. Properties Pure tungsten is a steel-gray to tin-white metal. Very pure tungsten can be cut with a hacksaw,  forged, spun, drawn, and extruded. The impure metal is brittle and can be worked only with difficulty. Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metals, and at temperatures over 1650'b0C has the highest tensile strength. The metal oxidizes in air and must be protected at elevated temperatures. It has excellent corrosion resistance and is attacked only slightly by most mineral acids. The thermal expansion is about the same as borosilicate glass, which makes the metal useful for glass-to-metal seals. Uses Tungsten and its alloys are used extensively for filaments for electric lamps, electron and television tubes, and for metal evaporation work; for electrical contact points for automobile distributors; X-ray targets; windings and heating elements for electrical furnaces; and for numerous spacecraft and high-temperature applications. High-speed tool steels, Hastelloy(R), Stellite(R), and many other alloys contain tungsten. Tungsten carbide is of great importance to the metal-working, mining, and petroleum industries. Calcium and magnesium tungstates are widely used in fluorescent lighting; other salts of tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries. Tungsten disulfide is a dry, high-temperature lubricant, stable to 500C. Tungsten bronzes and other tungsten compounds are used in paints.",

    "history": "From the Latin word iris meaning rainbow. Tennant discovered iridium in 1803 in the residue left when crude platinum is dissolved by aqua regia. The name iridium is appropriate because its salts are highly colored. Properties Iridium, a metal of the platinum family, is white (similar to platinum) but with a slight yellowish cast. Because iridium is very hard and brittle, it is hard to machine, form, or work. It is the most corrosion-resistant metal known, and was used in making the standard meter bar of Paris, which is a 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium alloy. This meter bar was replaced in 1960 as a fundamental unit of length (see Krypton). Iridium is not attacked by any of the acids nor by aqua regia, but is attacked by molten salts, such as NaCl and NaCN. The specific gravity of iridium is to osmium's specific gravity. Calculations of the densities of iridium and osmium from the space lattices give values of 22.65 and 22.61 g/cm^3, respectively. These values may be more reliable than actual physical measurements for determining which element is heavier.",

Platinum resistance wires are used for constructing high-temperature electric furnaces. The metal is used for coating missile nose cones, jet engine fuel nozzles, etc., which must perform reliably at high temperatures for long periods of time. The metal, like palladium, absorbs large volumes of hydrogen, retaining it at ordinary temperatures but giving it up when heated. In the finely divided state platinum is an excellent catalyst, having long been used in the contact process for producing sulfuric acid. It is also used as a catalyst in cracking petroleum products. Much interest exists in using platinum as a catalyst in fuel cells and in antipollution devices for automobiles. Platinum anodes are extensively used in cathodic protection systems for large ships and ocean-going vessels, pipelines, steel piers, etc. Fine platinum wire will glow red hot when placed in the vapor of methyl alcohol. It acts here as a catalyst, converting the alcohol to formaldehyde. The phenomenon has been used commercially to produce cigarette lighters and hand warmers.

    "history": "From Greek hydoor. Known to ancient Chinese and Hindus; found in Egyptian tombs of 1500 B.C. Mercury is the only common metal liquid at ordinary temperatures. It only rarely occurs free in nature. The chief ore is cinnabar; Spain and Italy produce about 50% of the world's supply of the metal. The commercial unit for handling mercury is the \"flask,\" which weighs 76 lb. The metal is obtained by heating cinnabar in a current of air and by condensing the vapor. Properties It is a heavy, silvery-white metal; a rather poor conductor of heat, as compared with other metals, and a fair conductor of electricity. It easily forms alloys with many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, which are called amalgams. Its ease in amalgamating with gold is made use of in the recovery of gold from its ores. The most important salts are mercury chloride (corrosive sublimate - a violent poison), mercurous chloride (calomel, occasionally still used in medicine), mercury fulminate, a detonator widely used in explosives, and mercuric sulfide (vermilion, a high-grade paint pigment). Organic mercury compounds are important. It has been found that an electrical discharge causes mercury vapor to combine with neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. These products, held together with van der Waals' forces, correspond to HgNe, HgAr, HgKr, and HgXe. Mercury is a virulent poison and is readily absorbed through the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, or through unbroken skin. It acts as a cumulative poison and dangerous levels are readily attained in air. Air saturated with mercury vapor at 20'b0C contains a concentration that exceeds the toxicity limits. The danger increases at higher temperatures. It is  important therefore that mercury be handled with care. Containers of mercury should be securely covered and spillage should be avoided. If it is necessary to heat mercury or mercury compounds, it should be done in a well-ventilated hood. Methyl mercury is a dangerous pollutant and is now widely found in water and streams. The triple point of mercury, -38.8344C, is a fixed point on the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90). Uses The metal is widely used in laboratory work for making thermometers, barometers, diffusion pumps, and many other instruments. It is used in making mercury-vapor lamps and advertising signs, etc. and is used in mercury switches and other electronic apparatus.

It is also used on brushes for removing dust from photographic films. The polonium for these is carefully sealed and controlled, minimizing hazards to the user. \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty five isotopes of polonium are known, with atomic masses ranging from 194 to 218. Polonium-210 is the most readily available. \n\nIsotopes\n of mass 209 (half-life 103 years) and mass 208 (half-life 2.9 years) can be prepared by alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron, but these are expensive to produce. Metallic polonium has been prepared from polonium hydroxide and some other polonium compounds in the presence of concentrated aqueous or anhydrous liquid ammonia. Two allotropic modifications are known to exist. \n\nHandling\nPolonium-210 is very dangerous to handle in even milligram or microgram amounts, and special equipment and strict control is necessary.

Francium, the heaviest known member of the alkali metals series, occurs as a result of an alpha disintegration of actinium. It can also be made artificially by bombarding thorium with protons. While it occurs naturally in uranium minerals, there is probably less than an ounce of francium at any time in the total crust of the earth. It has the highest equivalent weight of any element, and is the most unstable of the first 101 elements of the periodic system. Thirty-three isotopes of francium are recognized. The longest lived 223Fr (Ac, K), a daughter of 227Ac, has a half-life of 22 min. This is the only isotope of francium occurring in nature. Because all known isotopes of francium are highly unstable, knowledge of the chemical properties of this element comes from radiochemical techniques. No weighable quantity of the element has been prepared or isolated. The chemical properties of francium most resemble cesium.",

    "history": "From the Greek aktis, aktinos, meaning beam or ray. Discovered by Andre Debierne in 1899 and independently by F. Giesel in 1902. Occurs naturally in association with uranium minerals. Properties Actinium-227, a decay product of uranium-235, is a beta emitter with a 21.6-year half-life. Its principal decay products are thorium-227 (18.5-day half-life), radium-223 (11.4-day half-life), and a number of short-lived products including radon, bismuth, polonium, and lead isotopes. In equilibrium with its decay products, it is a powerful source of alpha particles. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300-degrees C. The chemical behavior of actinium is similar to that of the rare earths, particularly lanthanum. Purified actinium comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days, and then decays according to its 21.6-year half-life. It is about 150 times as active as radium, making it of value in the production of neutrons. In April of 2012, Los Alamos National Laboratory announced a new medical isotope project that shows promise for rapidly producing major quantities of a new cancer-treatment agent, actinium 225 (Ac-225). Both a press release and a video are available. ",

    "uses": "The principal historic use of thorium has been in the preparation of the Welsbach mantle, used for portable gaslights. These mantles, consisting of thorium oxide with about 1% cerium oxide and other ingredients, glow with a dazzling light when heated in a gas flame. Thorium is an important alloying element in magnesium, imparting high strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures. Because thorium has a low work-function and high electron emission, it is used to coat tungsten wire used in electronic equipment. The oxide is also used to control the grain size of tungsten used for electric lamps; it is also used for high-temperature laboratory crucibles. Glasses containing thorium oxide have a high refractive index and low dispersion. Consequently, they find application in high quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. Thorium oxide has also found use as a catalyst in the conversion of ammonia to nitric acid, in petroleum cracking, and in producing sulfuric acid. Thorium metal is a source of nuclear power. There is probably more energy available for use from thorium in the minerals of the earth's crust than from both uranium and fossil fuels. Any sizable demand from thorium as a nuclear fuel is still several years in the future. Work has been done in developing thorium cycle converter-reactor systems. Several prototypes, including the HTGR (high-temperature gas-cooled reactor) and MSRE (molten salt converter reactor experiment), have operated. While the HTGR reactors are efficient, they are not expected to become important commercially for many years because of certain operating difficulties. Production  Several methods are available for producing thorium metal; it can be obtained by reducing thorium oxide with calcium, by electrolysis of anhydrous thorium chloride in a fused mixture of sodium and potassium chlorides, by calcium reduction of thorium tetrachloride mixed with anhydrous zinc chloride, and by reduction of thorium tetrachloride with an alkali metal.  Hazards Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and will often ignite spontaneously in air. Thorium disintegrates with the production of \"thoron\" (220Rn), which is an alpha emitter and presents a radiation hazard. Good ventilation of areas where thorium is stored or handled is therefore essential. Secondary decay products of thorium include radium and actinium. Because of this, there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles and some nuclear safety agencies state precautions about their use. Further reading Mathias S.

    "history": "Morten Esmark found a black mineral on L'f8v'f8ya island, Norway and gave a sample to his father Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist. The elder Esmark was not able to identify it and sent a sample to Swedish chemist J'f6ns Jakob Berzelius for examination in 1828. In 1829 Berzelius determined that it contained a new element, which he named thorium after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. The metal had no practical uses until 1885 when Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle. Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, independently, by Polish-French physicist Marie Curie and German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt. Between 1900 and 1903, Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The crystal bar process (or \"iodide process\") was discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 to produce high-purity metallic thorium. Because of health concerns, the thorium in classic lantern mantles has been replaced by rare-earth elements that also produce intense light without the radioactivity. \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty-seven thorium radioisotopes have been characterized, with a range in atomic weight from 210 to 236. All are unstable with the most stable being 232Th with a half-life of 14.05 billion years. Thorium-232 represents all but a trace of naturally occurring thorium. It is an alpha emitter and goes through six alpha and four beta decay steps before becoming the stable isotope 208Pb. 232Th is sufficiently radioactive to expose a photographic plate in a few hours. Other isotopes of thorium are short-lived intermediates in the decay chains of higher elements, and only found in trace amounts. The longer-lived of these trace isotopes include: 230Th with a half-life of 75,380 years which is a daughter product of 238U decay; 229Th with a half-life of 7340 years and 228Th with a half-life of 1.92 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives less than ten minutes. Much of the internal heat the earth produces has been attributed to thorium and uranium.",

    "history": "The name \"protactinium\" comes from adding the Greek protos meaning first, before the word \"actinium.\" In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element between thorium and uranium. In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium from uraniu. It was an intensely radioactive material, however, he could not characterize it as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium-X. In 1913 the first isotope of element 91, 234Pa, was discovered by K. Fajans and O.H. Gohring.'a0 It was a very short-lived member of the naturally occurring 238U decay series and as such they named it \"brevium.\" In 1917/18, two groups of scientists, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered another isotope of protactinium, 231Pa having much longer half-life of about 32,000'a0years. The name was changed to proto-actinium as being more consistent with the longer-lived characteristics of the most abundant isotope. In 1927, Grosse prepared 2 mg of a white powder, which was shown to be Pa2O5. In 1934 he isolated the element from 0.1 g of pure Pa2O5 by two methods, one of which was by converting the oxide to an iodide and \"cracking\" it in a high vacuum by an electrically heated filament by the reaction: 2PaI5 --> 2Pa + 5I2. In 1949, the name protoactinium was shortened by the IUPAC who officially named it protactinium and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as co-discoverers. The new name meant \"parent of actinium\" and reflected the fact that actinium is a decay product of the radioactive decay of protactinium.  \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty-nine radioisotopes of protactinium have been discovered. Nearly all naturally occurring protactinium is 231Pa with a half-life of 32,700 years. It is an alpha emitter and is formed by the decay of uranium-235, whereas the beta radiating protactinium-234 with a half-life of 6.74 hours is produced as a result of uranium-238 decay. Nearly all uranium-238 (99.8%) decays first to the 234mPa isomer and then to 234Pa. Smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 as part of the chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. ",

    "uses": "Uranium was used in as coloring agents in ceramic glazes and glass in ancient Rome and in the Middle Ages producing orange-red to lemon yellow hues. More recently it was used as an orange glaze in contemporary Fiestaware'a9 dishware but was later discontinued for health reasons. Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. This means it can be split into two or three fragments (fission products) by thermal neutrons. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. This nuclear conversion can be brought about in breeder reactors where it is possible to produce more new fissionable material than the fissionable material used in maintaining the chain reaction. Depleted uranium (238U) (depleted of uranium-235) is used in balistic armor penetration and as armor plating. Uranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium-239, another fissile isotope. Indeed, the238U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium-239. 239U decays by beta emission to neptunium-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. 239Pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the \"Trinity test\" on 15 July 1945 in New Mexico.  Uranium-235 is of even greater importance because it is the key to utilizing uranium. 235U, while occurring in natural uranium to the extent of only 0.71%, is so fissionable with slow neutrons that a self-sustaining fission chain reaction can be made in a reactor constructed from natural uranium and a suitable moderator, such as heavy water or graphite, alone. Uranium-235 can be concentrated by gaseous diffusion and other physical processes, if desired, and used directly as a nuclear fuel, instead of natural uranium, or used as an explosive. Natural uranium, slightly enriched with 235U by a small percentage, is used to fuel nuclear power reactors to generate electricity. Natural thorium can be irradiated with neutrons to produce the important isotope 233U as follows: 232Th(n, gamma) --> 233Th(beta) --> 233Pa(beta) --> 233U. While thorium itself is not fissionable, 233U is, and in this way may be used as a nuclear fuel. One pound of completely fissioned uranium has the fuel value of over 1500 tons of coal. The uses of nuclear fuels to generate electrical power, to make isotopes for peaceful purposes, and to make explosives are well known. Uranium in the U.S.A. is controlled by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. New uses are being found for depleted uranium, i.e., uranium with the percentage of 235U lowered to about 0.2%. Uranium is used in inertial guidance devices, in gyro compasses, as counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile reentry vehicles, and as a shielding material. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets for production of high-energy X-rays; the nitrate was once used as a photographic toner, and the acetate was once used in analytical chemistry. Crystals of uranium nitrate are triboluminescent. Uranium salts have also been used for producing yellow \"Vaseline\" glass and glazes.  Hazards Uranium and its compounds are highly toxic, both from a chemical and radiological standpoint. Finely divided uranium metal, being pyrophoric, presents a fire hazard. In nature, U(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear waste repositories which leads to health hazards. Working with uranium requires the knowledge of the maximum allowable concentrations that may be inhaled or ingested. Recently, the natural presence of uranium in many soils has become of concern to homeowners because of the generation of radioactive radon gas and its daughters particularly in confined spaces with low circulation such as basements.

    "history": "The use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to 79 A.D. when it was used as a yellow coloring agent in ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in an ancient Roman villa near Naples, Italy. In the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from the silver mines and was used as a coloring agent in the glassmaking industry. The identification of uranium as an element is generally credited to Martin H. Klaproth. While experimenting with pitchblende in 1789, he concluded that it contained a new element, which he named after the newly discovered planet Uranus (named after the Greek god of the sky or heaven). What Klaproth actually identified was not the pure element but uranium oxide. The pure metal was first isolated in 1841 by Eug'e8ne-Melchior P'e9ligot, who reduced anhydrous uranium tetrachloride with potassium metal. In 1896 Antoine H. Becquerel discovered that uranium exhibited invisible light or rays; it was radioactivity. In 1934 research by Enrico Fermi and others eventually led to the use of uranium fission in the first nuclear weapon used in war and later in the peaceful use of uranium as fuel in nuclear power production.'a0An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern.  In 1972 French physicist Francis Perrin discovered ancient and no longer active prehistoric natural nuclear fission reactors in uranium ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; at that time, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth (0.72% today). This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting geologic conditions exist.  \n\nIsotopes\n Uranium is weakly radioactive because all naturally occurring (or primordial) isotopes of uranium (238U, 235U and 234U) are unstable, with half-lives varying between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. There are 27 known isotopes of uranium ranging in atomic weights 217'96219, 222'96240 and 242, with half-lives of from billions of years to a few nanoseconds. Naturally occurring uranium consists of three major isotopes: 238U (99.28% abundance), 235U (0.71%), and 234U (0.0054%). (The US DOE has adopted the value of 0.711 as being their official percentage of 235U in natural uranium.) All three isotopes are radioactive, with small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission but preferentially decaying by alpha emission. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the age of the Earth.'a0It also suggests that half of the uranium that existed from the formation of the Earth has decayed to other radioactive elements and eventually to stable elements. Much of the internal heat of the earth is thought to be attributable to the decay of uranium and thorium radio-isotopes. Uranium-238 is an ",

The most significant was by Enrico Fermi who believed that bombarding uranium with neutrons followed by beta decay would lead to the formation of element 93. In 1934, he bombarded uranium atoms with neutrons and reported that he had produced elements 93 and 94. As it turned out, Fermi had actually fissioned or split uranium atoms into many fragment radioisotopes. The explanation and announcement of the discovery of fission was later published by Hahn and Strassman, although it was their co-worker Lisa Meitner who had correctly interpreted the results of the experiments. In 1940, with excitement about fission reaching the University of California at Berkeley, Professor Edwin McMillan and graduate student Philip Abelson bombarded uranium with cyclotron-produced moderated (slow) neutrons, resulting not in '93fission'94 but \"fusion\" of the reactants forming the new element 93, which they named \"neptunium\":  23892U + 10n ",

    "history": "Plutonium is the second transuranium element of the actinide series. Element 93 was discovered in 1940/41 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin M. McMillan, J. W. Kennedy, and A. C. Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley Lab. They first synthesized neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) which subsequently beta-decayed to form a new heavier element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). It was fitting that element 94 be named after the next planetoid, Pluto following the precedence that uranium was named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune. Seaborg submitted a paper to the journal Physical Review in March 1941 documenting the discovery, but the paper was quickly withdrawn when it was found that an isotope of plutonium, Pu-239 could undergo nuclear fission making it useful in developing an atomic bomb. Pu-239 had a fission cross-section 50% greater than that of 235U, the best fissioning element known at that time.  Seaborg was called away from Berkeley to lead the Plutonium Production Lab or \"Met Lab\" at the University of Chicago.'a0The Met Lab was to produce useful quantities of plutonium as part of the secret Manhattan Project during World War II to develop an atomic bomb. On August 18, 1942, a trace quantity of plutonium was isolated and measured at the Met Lab for the first time. About 50'a0micrograms of Pu-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1'a0microgram was isolated. This was enough material for chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. In November 1943 a few milligrams of PuF3 was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal. Enough plutonium was produced to make it the first man-made element to be visible to the unaided eye. The nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also being studied and researchers found that when hit with a neutron it fissions by releasing energy and more neutrons. These neutrons can hit neighboring atoms of Pu-239 and so on, in an exponentially fast chain-reaction, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy could result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city or fuel a nuclear reactor. During WW II the three primary research and production sites of the Manhattan Project were the Plutonium Production Facility at what is now the Hanford Site, Washington, the Uranium Enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory. In 1943, the first production reactor that made Pu-239 was the X-10 Graphite Reactor built at a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee that later became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Manhattan Project produced the plutonium for the \"Trinity Test\" conducted in New Mexico by Los Alamos Laboratory Director Robert Oppenheimer and Army General Leslie Groves. The world'92s first atomic bomb (\"The Gadget\") was exploded near Socorro, New Mexico on July 16, 1945, resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent of approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. The first atomic bomb used in war had a uranium core and was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. The second atomic bomb used had a plutonium core and was nicknamed \"Fat Man\" because of its round shape. It was used to destroy Nagasaki, Japan in August 9, 1945, which put an end to WW II. Publication of the discovery and the naming of the new element plutonium was delayed until a year after the end of World War II.'a0 Seaborg originally considered the name \"plutium\", but later thought that it did not sound as good as \"plutonium.\"Later, during the Cold-War era, large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both the Soviet Union and the United States. Each year about 20'a0tons of plutonium is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry. As of 2007 it was estimated that the plutonium stockpile was about 500 tons, world-wide. Since the end of the Cold War these stockpiles have become a focus of nuclear proliferation concerns. In 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation mutually agreed to each dispose of 34 tons of weapon grade plutonium before the end of 2019 by converting it to a mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors. Today plutonium-239 remains an important component of nuclear weapons, and the United States maintains plutonium-related capabilities in support of national defense and global nuclear deterrence. Pu-239 for civilian nuclear power plants provides energy for many nations. Plutonium-238 continues to be vital to space exploration pushing the limits beyond which manned space exploration is possible and satisfying our quest for knowledge. \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty-three radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized from mass numbers 228 to 247. Nine of these exhibit metastable states, though these all have half-lives less than one second. The longest-lived isotopes are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8'a0million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300'a0years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110'a0years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 7,000'a0years. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and ",

    "uses": "Plutonium has assumed the position of dominant importance among the transuranium elements because of its use as an explosive ingredient in nuclear weapons and the place which it holds as a key material in the development of industrial use of nuclear power. During fission, a fraction of the binding energy, which holds a nucleus together, is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy which is quickly converted to thermal energy. Fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21,000 tons of TNT which is equivalent to about 22 million kilowatt hours of heat energy. In 1982 it was estimated that about 300,000 kg had accumulated. The most common chemical process, PUREX (Plutonium'96URanium EXtraction) reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed U/Pu oxide or \"MOX\" fuel for reuse in nuclear power reactors. MOX fuel production is also a good mechanism to reduce excessive defense plutonium stockpiles for peaceful purposes, which in effect is forging \"swords into plowshares.\"  Plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay, which produces decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. Pu-238 with a half-life of 88 years has a relatively high heat production rate which makes it useful as a power source with a long service life. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. Pu-238 is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power spacecraft and extra-terrestrial rovers. As a power and heat source, Pu-238 has also been used to power instruments left on the Moon by Apollo astronauts, weather satellites and interplanetary probes and powers the Cassini Saturn mission and the Mars rovers. Plutonium-238 was at one time used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers but has been replaced by lithium-based primary cells. Plutonium-238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba divers. Pu-238 mixed with beryllium is a convenient method to generate neutrons. Pu-238 powers the Cassini Mission now orbiting Saturn. (NASA) Hazards Plutonium, along with all of the other transuranium elements, is a radiological hazard and must be handled with specialized equipment and precautions. Animal studies have found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue are lethal. Plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested. When inhaled, plutonium can pass into the bloodstream moving throughout the body and into the bones, liver, or other body organs. Plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer. Precautions must also be taken to prevent the unintentional formulation of a critical mass. Pure Pu-239 metal present in sufficient quantity with an appropriate geometry can form a critical mass and pose a serious and often lethal criticality event. Low levels of plutonium in the environment is a result of world-wide fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests during the Cold War (now banned) pose little health hazard. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern.  Further Reading D. L. Clark, S.

    "history": "Americium was the fourth synthetic transuranic element to be discovered and was named after the continent of North America by analogy to its lighter lanthanide homologue, europium, which was named after Europe, its continent of discovery. Americium was made by Glenn Seaborg, Ralph James, Leon Morgan, and Albert Ghiorso late in 1944 at the wartime metallurgical laboratory at the University of Chicago. It was made as the result of successive neutron capture reactions by plutonium isotopes in a nuclear reactor.'a0The product element was quite difficult to separate based on its anticipated properties, which were incorrect as it turned out. Unlike the lighter previously discovered transuranium elements placed in the main block of the periodic table, americium behaved chemically like the lanthanide series of elements. It exhibited, for example, the trivalent state as the most stable in aqueous solutions. This behavior and the similar behavior of the newly discovered element, curium, prompted Glenn Seaborg to boldly and radically revise the periodic table and create the actinide series of elements. The first americium isotope identified was that of 241Am, which has an alpha decay half-life of 432.2 years to daughter neptunium-237. The initial discovery was classified as secret as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II, but the discovery was later declassified. Seaborg announced the discovery of elements 95, americium 96, and curium on the U.S. children'92s radio show,\"The Quiz Kids\" five days before his planned presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting in November 1945. His announcement resulted when one of the young listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered. 'a0'a0 Properties The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium were not prepared until 1951 via reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100 'b0C, producing up to 200 milligrams. The luster of freshly prepared americium metal is white and more silvery than plutonium or neptunium prepared in the same manner. It appears to be more malleable than uranium or neptunium and tarnishes slowly in dry air at room temperature. In solution, oxidation states III, IV, V, and VI are known and there is an unsubstantiated claim of the existence of Am(VII).'a0 Am(IV) is unstable in acidic media but in strongly basic carbonate solutions Am(IV) is stable. In fact, in carbonate solutions, americium has been shown to be the second element after plutonium to have in coexistence all four oxidation states simultaneously. There are numerous compounds of americium. Its oxides have the most practical applications.  \n\nIsotopes\n  About 19 isotopes and 8 nuclear isomers are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241Am and 243Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242Am has a half-life of 141 years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64 microseconds for 245Am to 50.8 hours for 240Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass. High purity kilogram quantities are now available for the longer lived isotopes, 241Am and 243Am. Uses There are many commercial applications for americium isotopes. Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers.

    "history": "Although curium follows americium in the periodic system, it was actually the third transuranium element to be discovered. It was identified by Seaborg, James, and Ghiorso in 1944 at the wartime metallurgical laboratory at the University of Chicago as a result of helium-ion bombardment of 239Pu in the Berkeley, California, 60-inch cyclotron. Visible amounts (30 'b5g) of 242Cm, in the form of the hydroxide, were first isolated by Werner and Perlman of the University of California in 1947. In 1950, Crane, Wallmann, and Cunningham found that the magnetic susceptibility of microgram samples of CmF3 was of the same magnitude as that of GdF3. This provided direct experimental evidence for assigning an electronic configuration to Cm+3. In 1951, the same workers prepared curium in its elemental form for the first time. Fourteen isotopes of curium are now known ranging in mass from 237 to 251. The most stable, 247Cm, with a half-life of 16 million years, is so short compared to the earth's age that any primordial curium must have disappeared long ago from the natural scene.  Properties Minute amounts of curium probably exist in natural deposits of uranium, as a result of a sequence of neutron captures and beta decays sustained by the very low flux of neutrons naturally present in uranium ores. The presence of natural curium, however, has never been detected. 242Cm and 244Cm are available in multigram quantities. 248Cm has been produced only in milligram amounts. Curium is similar in some regards to gadolinium, its rare earth homolog, but it has a more complex crystal structure. Curium metal is lustrous, malleable, silver in color, chemically reactive, and is more electropositive than aluminum. Curium metal exist in two crystal forms, a double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) and a high temperature face-centered cubic close packed (fcc) structure. Metallic curium dissolves rapidly in dilute acid to form Cm(III) solutions. Curium metal surfaces rapidly oxidize in air to form a thin film possibly starting out as CmO, Oxidation then progressing to Cm2O3, and eventually to form stable CmO2. Note however that the formation of divalent compounds of curium such as CmO have never been observed in bulk form. Most compounds and solutions of trivalent curium are quite stable and are faintly yellow or yellow-green in color. The stability of the trivalent state for curium is attributed to the half-filled 5f7 electron shell configuration. Curium in the tetravalent state is meta-stable in concentrated fluoride solutions but very stable in the solid state, primarily as the oxides and fluorides. Because curium isotopes are available in macro quantities a number of curium compounds have been prepared and characterized with the majority in the trivalent state.  242Cm generates about three watts of thermal energy per gram. This compares to one-half watt per gram of 238Pu. Both 242Cm and 244Cm have been used as power sources for space and medical uses. 244Cm is now offered for sale at $100/mg. Curium absorbed into the body accumulates in the bones, and is therefore very toxic as its radiation destroys the red-cell forming mechanism. The maximum permissible total body burden of 244Cm (soluble) in a human being is 0.3 microcurie. This element reviewed and Updated by Dr. David Hobart, 2011",

    "history": "Berkelium, the eighth member of the actinide transition series, was first produced in 1949 by Thompson, Ghiorso, and Seaborg via accelerator bombardment of 241Am with high energy alpha particles. This generated a new electron-capture activity eluting on a chromatography column just ahead of curium. This activity was assigned to an isotope of element 97 with mass number 243. It was named berkelium after Berkeley, California, the city of its discovery. Initial investigation of its chemical properties were limited to tracer experiments (ion exchange and co-precipitation) but these were sufficient to establish the stability of Bk(III) and the accessibility of Bk(IV) ions in aqueous solution and provide an estimate of the electrochemical potential of the Bk(IV)/Bk(III) couple. A complete study of an element is not possible by tracer methods alone, so a campaign was initiated in 1952 for long-term irradiation of about 8 grams of 239Pu in a nuclear reactor in Arco, Idaho to provide macro amounts of berkelium. In 1958 about 0.6 micrograms of 249Bk with a half-life of 330 days was recovered, separated, and purified by Cunningham et al. who determined the absorption spectrum in aqueous solution and measured the magnetic susceptibility of Bk(III). The first structural determination of a berkelium compound was in 1962. Four X-ray diffraction lines were obtained from 4 nanograms of berkelium-249 dioxide and indexed as face centered cubic. The first bulk (> 1 microgram) samples of berkelium metal were prepared in 1969 by reduction of BkF3 with lithium metal vapor at 1300 K by Haire and Peterson et al. Bk metal issilvery in appearance, easily soluble in dilute mineral acids, and rapidly oxidized by air or oxygen at elevated temperatures to form the oxide. The metal exhibits two crystal forms: double hexagonal closest packed (dhcp) and face centered cubic (fcc). Numerous alloys and compounds of berkelium have been prepared and studied including hydrides, oxides, halides, chalcogenides, pnictides, oxalates, oxychlorides, organometallic, and coordination compounds to name a few. Berkelium oxidation states Bk(0), Bk(III), and Bk(IV) are known in bulk and some evidence has been offered for the existence of Bk(II) but there is only speculation on the possible existence of Bk(V) ions. Fourteen isotopes of berkelium are now known and have been synthesized from mass number 238 to 251. As with other actinide elements, berkelium tends to accumulate in the skeletal system. Because of its rarity, berkelium presently has no commercial use, however, with its relatively long half-life and availability in microgram quantities, Bk-249 is used extensively as a target to synthesize heavier elements by charged particle bombardment. Berkelium is the first member of the second half of the actinide series and as such, studies of the physicochemical properties of this element enables more accurate extrapolations to the behavior of the heavier elements for which studies are severely limited by scarcity of material, very short half-lives, and intense radioactivity.

    "history": "Californium, the sixth transuranium element to be discovered, was produced by Thompson, Street, Ghioirso, and Seaborg in 1950 by bombarding microgram quantities of 242Cm with 35 MeV helium ions in the Berkeley 60-inch cyclotronproducing 244Cf. Since the lanthanide homologue of californium (dysprosium) has a stable trivalent state in aqueous solution it was anticipated that californium would exhibit a stable trivalent state as well. This accurate prediction allowed for the successful chromatographic separation of californium from other actinides and for its unequivocal identification. \n\nIsotopes\n Twenty isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 237 to 256 have been reported for californium however the existence of the isotopes with mass of 237 and 238 has not yet been confirmed. The isotope 249Cf results from the beta decay of 249Bk while the heavier isotopes are produced by intense neutron irradiation by nuclear reactors or in thermonuclear explosions. The existence of the isotopes 249Cf, 250Cf, 251Cf, and 252Cf makes it feasible to isolate californium in weighable amounts so that its physicochemical properties can be investigated with macroscopic quantities.  The first well-defined structure of a californium compound was the oxychloride by Cunningham and Wallmann a decade after discovery of the element. Microgram quantities of californium have been produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee and in Dimitrovgrad high-flux reactors in Russia. Californium-252 is a very strong neutron emitter. One microgram releases 170 million neutrons per minute, which presents biological hazards. Cf-252 also decays by energetic alpha emission (half-life 2.65 years, 6.1 MeV). Proper safeguards should be used when handling californium isotopes. Properties Californium is the second half of the actinide series where its f electrons are further removed or shielded from the valence electrons that those of the lighter actinides.  Thus californium resembles the behavior of the lanthanide elements exhibiting divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent oxidation states in solid-state compounds.  In solution, the trivalent state is the most stable however the divalent, tetravalent and a possible pentavalent state have been reported.  The existence of Cf(V) is questionable. Californium metal is fairly reactive. On standing in air or moisture, small pieces or foils of Cf metal quickly form an oxide but not in a violent reaction.  Two methods have been successful for preparation of Cf metal: reduction of californium trifluoride with lithium metal at elevated temperature and using thorium or lanthanum metal to reduce californium oxide (R. G. Haire, 1982).  The largest amount of metal prepared at one time was about 10 milligrams.  The metal was eventually determined to be trivalent with a room-temperature double hexagonal close-packed structure.  A face centered cubic structure has also been observed for californium metal at high temperature. Some alloys and numerous solid-state compounds have been prepared with californium in spite of the fact that only small amounts of the element are available at any one time.  Californium compounds include oxides, halides, oxyhalides, pnictides, chacogenides hydrides, tellurides, oxysulfate and oxysulfide to name a few.  Some organo-californium coumpounds have also been prepared. Because californium is a very efficient source of neutrons, many new uses are expected for it. It has already found use in neutron moisture gauges and in well-logging (the determination of water and oil-bearing layers). It is also being used as a portable neutron source for discovery of metals such as gold or silver by on-the-spot activation analysis. 252Cf is now being offered for sale by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory at a cost of $10/mg. As of May, 1975, more than 63 mg have been produced and sold. It has been suggested that californium may be produced in certain stellar explosions, called supernovae, for the radioactive decay of 254Cf (55-day half-life) agrees with the characteristics of the light curves of such explosions observed through telescopes. This suggestion, however, is questioned. Further reading: Richard G. Haire (2006) Chapter 11, \"The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide  Element,\" Third Edition, L. R. Morss, J.

    "history": "Einsteinium, the seventh transuranic element of the actinide series to be discovered, was identified by Ghiorso and co-workers at Berkeley in December 1952 in debris from the first large thermonuclear explosion, which took place in the Pacific in November, 1952. The 20-day 253Es isotope was produced. It was named after Alfred Einstein. In 1961, enough einsteinium was produced to separate a macroscopic amount of 253Es. This sample weighted about 0.01'b5g and was measured using a special magnetic-type balance. 253Es so produced was used to produce mendelevium (Element 101) by neutron bombardment. About 3 'b5g of einsteinium has been produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratories by: irradiating kilogram quantities of 239Pu in a reactor for several years to produce 242Pu, fabricating the 242Pu into pellets of plutonium oxide and aluminum powder, loading the pellets into target rods for an initial 1-year irradiation at the Savannah River Plant, and, irradiating the targets for another 4 months in the HFIR. The targets were then removed for chemical separation of the einsteinium from californium daughter products. About 2 milligrams of einsteinium can be present in special HFIR campaigns. \n\nIsotopes\n Sixteen isotopes with three isomers ranging in atomic mass from 241 to 256 are now recognized for einsteinium. 252Es has the longest half-life (472 days) but is only available in minute quantities. The isotopes 253Es and 254Es are the isotopes of choice for physicochemical studies because of their availability and reasonable half-lives. However, usually only a few micrograms of einsteinium isotopes are used in experiments to reduce worker exposure and to minimize the intense self-irradiation effects. Properties Tracer studies using 253Es show that einsteinium has chemical properties typical of a heavy trivalent, actinide element. Oxidation states of II and III for einsteinium have been reported and oxidation state IV has been postulated from vapor transport studies but not established unequivocally. Einsteinium is the first divalent metal in the actinide series (two bonding electrons rather than three).  The self-irradiation properties of einsteinium make it extremely difficult, for example, to obtain x-ray crystallographic data. The intense gamma and x-rays from einsteinium decay to daughter products over-exposes the x-ray film/detector.  This intense self-irradiation can be exploited however to study accelerated aging and radiation damage studies, and for targeted radiation medical treatments. An example of einsteinium chemical studies is the chemical consequences of radioactive decay.  With the relatively short half-life of Es-253 (20.47 days) one can study the in-growth of daughter Bk-249 (half-life 330 days) and grand-daughter Cf-249 (half-life 351 years).  Evidence suggests that divalent Es might decay into a divalent Bk daughter and subsequently into as of yet unknown divalent Cf. There are no commercial uses for einsteinium however it is the heaviest element for which bulk studies can be performed that allows for fundamental studies of the role of 5-f electrons in actinide systematics.

Element 100 was first discovered in 1952 in the fallout from the 10-megaton \"Ivy Mike\" nuclear test in the south Pacific the first successful test of a hydrogen fusion bomb. Researchers identified a new Pu-244 isotope found on filter papers on drone aircraft flown through the fallout. They determined that it could only have formed by the unexpected absorption of six neutrons by uranium-238 followed by successive beta-decays. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of Pu-244 raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei leading to additional new elements. Element'a099, einsteinium was discovered almost immediately on other filter papers by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in collaboration with Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, demonstrating that 15 neutrons were captured by U-238! The subsequent discovery of fermium required more material, as the yield of element 100 was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of einsteinium. So, contaminated coral from ground zero on Eniwetok atoll was shipped to Berkeley for processing and analysis. About two months after the Ivy-Mike test, a new activity was isolated emitting high-energy ",

Seaborg, who used a new double-recoil technique. A heavy-ion linear accelerator (HILAC) was used to bombard a thin target of curium (95%244Cm and 4.5% 246Cm) with 12C ions to produce 102No according to the 246Cm(12C, 4n) reaction. In 1957 workers in the United States, Britain, and Sweden announced the discovery of an isotope of element 102 with a 10-minute half-life at 8.5 MeV, as a result of bombarding 244Cm with 13C nuclei. On the basis of this experiment, the name nobelium was assigned and accepted by the Commission on Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The acceptance of the name was premature because both Russian and American efforts now completely rule out the possibility of any isotope of Element 102 having a half-life of 10 min in the vicinity of 8.5 MeV. Early work in 1957 on the search for this element, in Russia at the Kurchatov Institute, was marred by the assignment of 8.9 +/- 0.4 MeV alpha radiation with a half-life of 2 to 40 sec, which was too indefinite to support discovery claims. Confirmatory experiments at Berkeley in 1966 have shown the existence of 254102 with a 55-s half-life, 252102 with a 2.3-s half-life, and 257102 with a 23-s half-life. Following tradition giving the right to name an element to the discoverer(s), the Berkeley group in 1967, suggested that the hastily given name nobelium along with the symbol No , be retained. \n\nIsotopes\n Ten isotopes are now recognized, one of which -- 255102 -- has a half-life of 3 minutes.",

Larsh, and R.M. Latimer. A 3-Mg californium target, consisting of a mixture of isotopes of mass number 249, 250, 251, and 252, was bombarded with either 10B or 11B. The electrically charged transmutation nuclei recoiled with an atmosphere of helium and were collected on a thin copper conveyor tape which was then moved to place collected atoms in front of a series of solid-state detectors. The isotope of element 103 produced in this way decayed by emitting an 8.6 MeV alpha particle with a half-life of 8 s. In 1967, Flerov and associates at the Dubna Laboratory reported their inability to detect an alpha emitter with a half-life of 8 s which was assigned by the Berkeley group to 257103. This assignment has been changed to 258Lr or 259Lr. In 1965, the Dubna workers found a longer-lived lawrencium isotope, 256Lr, with a half-life of 35 s. In 1968, Thiorso and associates at Berkeley used a few atoms of this isotope to study the oxidation behavior of lawrencium. Using solvent extraction techniques and working very rapidly, they extracted lawrencium ions from a buffered aqueous solution into an organic solvent -- completing each extraction in about 30 s.

    "history": "In 1964, workers at the Joint Nuclear Research Institute at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) bombarded plutonium with accelerated 113 to 115 MeV neon ions. By measuring fission tracks in a special glass with a microscope, they detected an isotope that decays by spontaneous fission. They suggested that this isotope, which had a half-life of 0.3 +/- 0.1 s might be 260-104, produced by the following reaction: 242Pu + 22Ne --> 260Rf +4n. Element 104, the first transactinide element, is expected to have chemical properties similar to those of hafnium. It would, for example, form a relatively volatile compound with chlorine (a tetrachloride). The Soviet scientists have performed experiments aimed at chemical identification, and have attempted to show that the 0.3-s activity is more volatile than that of the relatively nonvolatile actinide trichlorides. This experiment does not fulfill the test of chemically separating the new element from all others, but it provides important evidence for evaluation. Data issued by Soviet scientists reduced the half-life of the isotope they worked with from 0.3 to 0.15 s. \n\nIsotopes\n In 1969 Ghiorso, Nurmia, Harris, K.A.Y. Eskola, and P.L. Eskola of the University of California at Berkeley reported that they had positively identified two, and possibly three isotopes of Element 104. The group indicated that, after repeated attempts, they produced isotope 260104 reported by the Dubna groups in 1964. The discoveries at Berkeley were made by bombarding a target of 249Cf with 12C nuclei of 71 MeV, and 13C nuclei of 69 MeV. The combination of 12C with 249Cf followed by instant emission of four neutrons produced Element 257104. This isotope has a half-life of 4 to 5 s, decaying by emitting an alpha particle into 253No, with a half-life of 105 s. The same reaction, except with the emission of three neutrons, was thought to have produced 258104 with a half-life of about 1/100 s. Element 259104 is formed by the merging of a 13C nuclei with 249Cf, followed by emission of three neutrons. This isotope has a half-life of 3 to 4 s, and decays by emitting an alpha particle into 255No, which has a half-life of 185 s. Thousands of atoms of 257104 and 259104 have been detected. The Berkeley group believes their identification of 258-104 is correct, but attaches less confidence to this work than to their work on 257104 and 259104. ",

    "history": "In 1967 G.N. Flerov reported that a Soviet team working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna may have produced a few atoms of  260105 and 261105 by bombarding 243Am with 22Ne. The evidence was based on time-coincidence measurements of alpha energies. In 1970 Dubna scientists synthesized Element 105 and, by the end of April 1970, \"had investigated all the types of decay of the new element and had determined its chemical properties,\" according to a report in 1970. The Soviet group had not proposed a name for 105. In late April 1970, it was announced that Ghiorso, Nurmia, Haris, K.A.Y. Eskola, and P.L. Eskola, working at the University of California at Berkeley, had positively identified element 105. The discovery was made by bombarding a target of 249Cf with a beam of 84 MeV nitrogen nuclei in the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). When a15N nuclear is absorbed by a 249Cf nucleus, four neutrons are emitted and a new atom of 260105 with a half-life of 1.6 s is formed. While the first atoms of Element 105 are said to have been detected conclusively on March 5, 1970, there is evidence that Element 105 had been formed in Berkeley experiments a year earlier by the method described. Ghiorso and his associates have attempted to confirm Soviet findings by more sophisticated methods without success. The Berkeley Group proposed the name hahnium -- after the late German scientist Otto Hahn (1879-1968) -- and symbol Ha.  However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry panel members in 1977 recommended that element 105 be named to Dubnium (symbol Db) after the site of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia. Unfortunately, the name hahnium will not be used again according to the rules for naming new elements. Some scientists still use the earlier name of hahnium because it had been used for about 25 years. \n\nIsotopes\n In October 1971, it was announced that two new isotopes of element 105 were synthesized with the heavy ion linear accelerator by A. Ghiorso and co-workers a Berkeley. Element 261105 was produced both by bombarding 250Cf with 15N and by bombarding 249Bk with 16O. The isotope emits 8.93-MeV alpha particles and decays to 257Lr with a half-life of about 1.8 s. Element 262105 was produced by bombarding 249Bk with 18O. It emits 8.45 MeV alpha particles and decays to 258Lr with a half-life of about 40 s. Seven isotopes of element 105 (unnilpentium) are now recognized. ",

In September 1974, workers of the Lawrence Berkeley and Livermore Laboratories also claimed creation Element 106 \"without any scientific doubt.\" The LBL and LLL Group used the Super HILAC to accelerate 18O ions onto a 249Cf target. Element 106 was created by the reaction 249Cf(18O, 4N)263X, which decayed by alpha emission to rutherfordium, and then by alpha emission to nobelium, which in turn further decayed by alpha between daughter and granddaughter. The element so identified had alpha energies of 9.06 and 9.25 MeV with a half-life of 0.9 +/- 0.2 s. At Dubna, 280-MeV ions of 54Cr from the 310-cm cyclotron were used to strike targets of 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb, in separate runs. Foils exposed to a rotating target disc were used to detect spontaneous fission activities. The foils were etched and examined microscopically to detect the number of fission tracks and the half-life of the fission activity. Other experiments were made to aid in confirmation of the discovery.",

If the combined energy of two nuclei is sufficiently high, the repulsive forces between the nuclei can be overcome. In this experiment, a week of target bombardment was required to produce a single fused nucleus. The team confirmed the existence of element 109 by four independent measurements. The newly formed atom recoiled from the target at predicted velocity and was separated from smaller, faster nuclei by a newly developed velocity filter. The time of flight to the detector and the striking energy were measured and found to match predicted values. The nucleus of 266X started to decay 5 ms after striking the detector. A high-energy alpha particle was emitted, producing 262/107X. This in turn emitted an alpha particle, becoming 258/105Db, which in turn captured an electron and became 258/104Rf. This in turn decayed into other nuclides. This experiment demonstrated the feasibility of using fusion techniques as a method of making new, heavy nuclei.",

Element 110 was produced by fusing a nickel and lead atom together. This was achieved by accelerating the nickel atoms to a high energy in the heavy ion accelerator.\"This rare reaction occurs only at a very specific velocity of the nickel projectile. Over a period of many days, many billion billion nickel atoms must be shot at a lead target in order to produce and identify a single atom of element 110. The atoms produced in the nickel-lead collisions are selected by a velocity filter and then captured in a detector system which measures their decay. The energy of the emitted helium nuclei serves to identify the atom\" (Press Release). This element was only found to have a lifetime of less than 1/1000th of a second. It is expected that soon a heavier version of element 110 that might be more stable, and that lives slightly longer will be developed. The name darmstatdium was confirmed by IUPAC in August 2003.",
